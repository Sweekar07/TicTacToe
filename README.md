# TicTacToe

This is my first program made using C++ on visual studio which I learned on Udemy course "Master Class forr C++" 

-> This is a two player game.

-> An char array is declared globally with marking 0-9. Each marking can be represented as an box for displayed 'X' and '0'.

-> The program will accpet the values from players as 'X' and '0' and declare the winner as per the rules.

-> If none of the player win. The Program displays a draw message.

-> Also, if the player chooses the box which is already marked as either 'X' or '0' then the program is able to retify those misclick and the player can try again untill he choses the not marked square box.
